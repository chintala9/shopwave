### Adding New Products
To add new products, modify the `products` array:

const newProduct = {
  id: 7,
  name: "New Product Name",
  price: 99.99,
  originalPrice: 129.99, // Optional for sale items
  category: "electronics", // electronics, fashion, home
  rating: 4.5,
  reviews: 85,
  image: "📱", // Emoji representation
  description: "Product description here",
  inStock: true,
  sale: true // If on sale
};
```

### Styling Customization
The application uses Tailwind CSS utility classes:

```javascript
// Color scheme customization
const primaryColors = "bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700"
const accentColors = "text-blue-600 border-blue-200"
const saleColors = "bg-red-500 text-white"
```

### Category Management
Add new categories in the categories array:

```javascript
const categories = [
  { id: 'books', name: 'Books', icon: '📚' },
  { id: 'sports', name: 'Sports', icon: '⚽' }
];
```
